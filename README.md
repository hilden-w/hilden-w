- 👋 Hi, I’m @hilden-w
- 👀 I’m interested in ... how to improve my programming skills, perferably tasks that I can be introduced that will give me the experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...java, in the 2nd Java class at my University, I also self-learned a bit of python, I did not think I would like programming, but I did, so lately I have been looking forward to expand my programming skills/knowledge on my own.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything, I wanna be introduced to everything, I would love to observe and learn if given the oppertunity, obviously imo I dont know enough to colloborate or help anyone
